🌦️ Weather Insights: Interactive Weather Tracking Dashboard
A dynamic, interactive data visualization dashboard designed to track and analyze real-time weather metrics and air quality indices across multiple cities—focusing on temperature trends, atmospheric conditions, and environmental health indicators.

📋 Short Description / Purpose
The Weather Insights Dashboard is an intuitive and analytical Power BI report created to help users monitor and compare weather and air quality data for multiple cities in real-time. It visualizes key metrics like temperature trends, humidity, precipitation, air pollutants, and sunrise/sunset times, empowering weather enthusiasts, environmental analysts, and urban planners with actionable insights.

🛠️ Tech Stack
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:

📊 Power BI Desktop – Core platform for dashboard design and interactivity.

📂 Power Query – Used for data transformation, shaping, and cleaning before visualization.

🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Powers dynamic calculations, KPIs, and conditional formatting.

📝 Data Modeling – Relationships established among tables (weather, air quality, cities) for seamless cross-filtering.

📁 File Format – .pbix for development, .png for dashboard preview.

📈 Data Source
Source: OpenWeatherMap API & Local Air Quality Monitoring Data.

The dataset comprises real-time weather and air quality observations for Bhubaneswar, Kolkata, Raipur, and other cities. Metrics include:

Temperature (°C)

Atmospheric pressure

Wind speed

Visibility

UV index

Humidity

Precipitation

Air Quality Index (SO₂, CO, NO₂, O₃, PM2.5, PM10)

Data is updated daily to reflect current conditions and short-term forecasts.

🌟 Features / Highlights
Business Problem
Urban residents and policymakers lack a consolidated, easy-to-use platform to monitor both weather and environmental air quality indicators across cities. Decisions around travel, health advisories, and infrastructure planning often rely on fragmented or raw data.

Key questions this dashboard answers:

What is the current temperature and forecast for the week in a selected city?

How severe are air pollutants like CO, NO₂, PM2.5, and PM10?

What is the likelihood of rain in the next 7 days?

When is sunrise and sunset in the selected location?

Goal of the Dashboard
To provide an interactive, visually engaging tool that:

Tracks real-time weather and air quality metrics across cities.

Enables informed decisions by travelers, residents, and environmental agencies.

Raises awareness about current and forecasted atmospheric conditions and their potential health impacts.
